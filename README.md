# whats-outside-api
Using all of the skills you’ve developed over the last two trimesters, you are now tasked with creating your very own **Custom API from scratch!** This includes creating your own database with custom scripts that setup the database, creating custom datasets to populate your database with, handling the ETL process, creating the API (required: user auth, pagination, caching, queuing systems VS web sockets), and creating the frontend.

There is only rule that must be followed… your application must follow the theme, ```“What’s Outside?”.``` You and your team are free to interpret that in any way you see fit (keep it Safe For Work, though)!

## Project Proposal
- Writeups of the design
  - What is it you are going to build and how does it fit the theme?
  - What tools will be used?
  - How long long will development of each part of the application take?
- API documentation
- UML (or similar) Database Documentation
- Wireframes for any implemented UI elements of the application

## The Backend
- **Setup Database**
  - I have chosen ```PostgreSQL``` for this application
  - Create custom ```PostgreSQL``` scripts to install database
- **Create dataset for the application**
  - Custom ```CSV``` files with format of previously written UML database documentation
- **Finish Database Setup**
  - Create custom ```PostgreSQL``` scripts to create tables to hold data from dataset
- **ETL process**
  - Now that our database is setup, we can start importing data into our database
    - Create custom ```python``` script using ```pandas``` to import data into our database from CSV files
- **Create API**
  - I have chosen ```Express``` for this application
  - **API must do the following:**
    - Authenticate users
	- Allow for pagination of data
	- Allow for caching of data to reduce hits to database
  - **API must also implement ONE of the following:**
    - Queueing systems
	- Web Sockets
  
## The Frontend
- Refer to wireframe for UI elements
  - **Page 1:**
    - Get started button to handle user authentication before allowing user to access the application
      - If not authenticated, user must be given an error and not allowed access to next page (where the application is)
	  - If authenticated, user can access the next page (where the application is)
  - **Page 2:**
    - 4 Cities to query
	  - User has ability to choose which city to query
	    - Can query multiple cities at once
	  - User has options of filtering with the following:
	    - Nature
		- Parks
		- Museums
		- Landmarks
		- Transportation
	  - Result Per Page? Option for pagination.
	  - Submit button to submit query
	    - Allow for caching of data to reduce hits to database
	- Results are displayed below filtering options and submit button.
